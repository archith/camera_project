#  This is a sample /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe script.
#  /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe script is executed by dhcpcd daemon
#  any time it configures or shuts down interface.
#  The following parameters are passed to dhcpcd.exe script:
#  $1 = HostInfoFilePath, e.g  "/etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info"
#  $2 = "up" if interface has been configured with the same
#       IP address as before reboot;
#  $2 = "down" if interface has been shut down;
#  $2 = "new" if interface has been configured with new IP address;
#  $3 (optional) = "-d" debug flag passed if dhcpcd daemon has been
#       invoked with "-d" flag
#
