----------------- PL1029 -----------------
  I) Build Procedure:
	# . ./setenv
	# make clean
	# make menuconfig
		config busybox	(SAVE without change)
		config kernel	(SAVE without change)
	# make all
	# make FW

	The F/W image is:  FW/WVC230.bin

 II) FLASH memory map
	src/bootloader/proboot-1.0.1/include/memconfig.h
	src/kernel/linux-2.4.19/include/asm-arm/arch-pl1029/memconfig.h
	FW/combine.cfg

	To include "asm/arch/hardware.h" is enough. It will include the 
	memconfig.h internally.

	The layout in memconfig and combine.cfg should be the same.
	The memconfig.h in both bootloader and kernel should be unique.

III) Source Structures
	ChangeLog.txt	Change Log (internal)
	setenv		Script to set the environment varialbes
	host/		PC Host relative files (scripts, mkcramfs...)
	img/		Temporary image files (kernel, filesystem...) which
			are generated by run-time
	 ../fs/			filesystem (by run-time)
	    ../root/		basic filesystem (by run-time)
	    ../shadow_root	busybox + applications (by run-time)
				The built apps should put under "shadow_root"
	lib/		libraries for the F/W (default libraries)
	 ../modules	kernel modules (by run-time)
	src/		All source files
	 ../bootloader/		boot loader
	 ../kernel/		linux kernel
	 ../kmods/		kernel modules
	 ../rootfs/		root filesystem (basic)
	 ../sysapps/		applications
	         ../busybox-1.01/	busybox
		 ../apps/		ALL applications
