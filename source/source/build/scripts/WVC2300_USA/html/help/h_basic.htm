 WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia). It is a standard created to define quality of service (QoS) in Wi-Fi networks. It is a precursor to the IEEE 802.11e WLAN QoS draft standard, which is meant to improve audio, video and voice applications transmitted over Wi-Fi. WMM adds prioritized capabilities to Wi-Fi networks and optimizes their performance when multiple concurring applications, each with different latency and throughput requirements, compete for network resources.

  <td class="itemhead" valign="top">Security</td>
   <td ><p>Click <strong>Edit Security Settings</strong> to display the  Wireless Security window.</p>
     <p><strong>Security Mode</strong> <br clear="all">
       Select the  appropriate option based on your wireless network configuration. Options are:  Disabled, WEP, WPA/WPA2 Personal, WPA/WPA2 Enterprise.</p>
     <p><strong>Disabled</strong> <br clear="all">
       This option  implements no security on your wireless network. Data is not encrypted before  transmission.</p>
     <p><strong>WEP</strong> <br clear="all">
       WEP is a  basic encryption method, which is not as secure as later methods such as WPA.  WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy.</p>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>TX Key</strong>&mdash;Select the number of the key used on the wireless network. </li>
       <li><strong>WEP Encryption</strong>&mdash;Select the appropriate  option for key length based on your network settings.</li>
       <li><strong>Passphrase</strong>&mdash;Type in the passphrase  used to generate WEP keys on your network and click <strong>Generate</strong>. </li>
       <li><strong>Key 1-4</strong>&mdash;Key values can be  entered in manually or generated from a passphrase.</li>
       <li><strong>Authentication</strong>&mdash;Select the appropriate  authentication type used on the wireless network.</li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>WPA/WPA2 &nbsp;Personal</strong> <br clear="all">
       This method offers two encryption methods, TKIP or AES, with dynamic encryption  keys. Enter the Shared Key, which can have 8 to 63 characters. Then enter the Key Renewal Timeout, which instructs the  device how often it should change the encryption keys. <br>
  <strong>WPA/WPA2 Enterprise</strong> <br clear="all">
       WPA2 Enterprise requires  some advanced expertise because it involves setting up a RADIUS server for  authentication and, in some cases, creation of certificates for both the RADIUS  server and the camera.</p>
     <p>If you are  using WPA/WPA2 Enterprise security, you will need to upload security  certificates to the camera. Certificates must be in the following format:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Root  certificate: DER encoded binary x.509 (CER)/PEM </li>
       <li>User  certificate: Personal Information Exchange (PKCS#12 (.PFX))</li>
     </ul>
     <p>In WPA/WPA2  Enterprise, you can choose your protocol type. Select between EAP-TLS and  EAP-TTLS.<br>
  &nbsp;<strong>EAP-TLS </strong><br>
       With EAP-TLS you enter the User ID and  Password for the RADIUS server and choose where the camera should check for the  server and user certificate. </p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li><strong>User ID</strong>&mdash;User ID is used for       login to your RADIUS server. </li>
       <li><strong>Root CA</strong>&mdash;A root certificate       is an unsigned public key certificate, or a self-signed certificate, which       implies that you trust your browser's publisher to include correct root       certificates, and in turn the certificate authorities it trusts, and       anyone to whom the CA may have issued a certificate-issuing-certificate,       to faithfully authenticate the users of all their certificates. </li>
       <li><strong>User CA</strong>&mdash;A user certificate       is a signed private key certificate, which implies that you trust your       browser's publisher to include correct user certificates, and in turn the       certificate authorities it trusts, and only user to whom the CA may have       issued a certificate-issuing-certificate, to faithfully authenticate the       users of all their certificates. </li>
       <li><strong>Password       (Private Key)&mdash;</strong>Client login to the RADIUS server, and must       match the key stored on the RADIUS server. </li>
     </ul>
     <p>&nbsp;<strong>EAP-TTLS </strong><br>
       With EAP-TTLS you choose the authentication  protocol (MS-CHAP V2, MS-CHAP, PAP, EAP-MD5) to transfer the CA to the  RADIUS server. You will also enter the User ID, Password, and Anonymous ID for  the RADIUS server and choose where the camera should check for the server  certificate. </p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li><strong>Process Method&mdash;</strong>Choose an authentication method       (MS-CHAP, MS-CHAP v2, PAP, EAP-MD5) as required to handle       the processing and transmission of the CA to your RADIUS server. </li>
       <li><strong>User ID&mdash;</strong>User ID is used for       login to your RADIUS server. </li>
       <li><strong>Password (Private Key)&mdash;</strong>This camera's client login to       the RADIUS server, and must match the key stored on the RADIUS server. </li>
       <li><strong>Anonymous       ID&mdash;</strong>The       unsigned public ID used for login to your RADIUS server. </li>
     </ul>
     <strong>Root CA&mdash;</strong>A root certificate is an unsigned public key certificate, or a  self-signed certificate, which implies that you trust your browser's publisher  to include correct root certificates, and in turn the certificate authorities  it trusts, and anyone to whom the CA may have issued a  certificate-issuing-certificate, to faithfully authenticate the users of all  their certificates.
